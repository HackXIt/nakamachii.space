# nakamachii.space

A personal project to host webpages under the domain nakamachii.space.

Those projects mainly deal with the game Eve Frontier and its blockchain technology, but I wanted to use the oppertunity to learn more about web development as well, since providing services for players of that game is a good way to get involved with projects serving a particular goal/community.

# Reasoning behind tech stack

This project is about learning and experimenting with web development. Since I don't know what sort of projects I will want to host under this domain, I at least want to define a tech stack that I will use for the projects in this repository.

I'm not a beginner programmer, but I figured since this is open-source and others might be interested, I will share here all individual things that I use and why I use them.

## Core stack

- **VueJS** as a frontend framework
- **TypeScript** for frontend script logic
- **Vite** as the build tool
- **Solidity** for smart contracts
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD

## Reasoning

- I want to use **VueJS** for the frontend. My workplace uses it. I am familiar with it. I like it from experience.
- I will code frontend / client code in **TypeScript**. I like the type safety, but most importantly, I want to learn it. However, I don't want to use it for the backend, simply because I have other languages in mind for that and my gut-feeling tells me that TypeScript is not the best choice for backend.
- I will use **Vite** as the build tool. It comes naturally with VueJS.
- I must code my smart assemblies / DApps in **solidity**, since that is what Eve Frontier requires.
- I will use **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD. I am familiar with it and it is also the tool to use for this hosting plattform.
- I don't know yet what I will use for server backend, nor do I know if I will need it. I will cross that bridge when I get there.
    - Java, Python and C# are language that I work with professionally, but for a web-development backend for a personal project I might choose something else. Simply for learning reasons and also widening my language experience.
- I don't know yet what I will use for database, nor do I know if I will need it. I will cross that bridge when I get there.
